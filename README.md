# Statistical_analysis

## *Statistical analysis using only C++*

- [x] Matrix calculation
- [x] Linear regression
- [x] Multiple regression
- [x] Sparse regression
- [x] Nonlinear regression
- [x] Principal component analysis
- [x] Independent component analysis
- [x] Eigenvalue analysis
- [x] Statistical causal search

----
The current aim is to create a **non-GPL C++ implementation** of a **linear non-Gaussian aperiodic model (LiNGAM)** which is one of the statistical causality search.

***Please wait.***  
**Execution efficiency and results are still bad.**  
**We are currently making modifications and changes.**  
**GPU support is experimental so performance is not good.**  
**The directory structure and file name will probably change in the future.**

In reality,
Since the GPU calculation is not an experimental level and the mounting method is very bad, the calculation speed is slower than the calculation by the CPU. That is the worst.
