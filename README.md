# Statistical_analysis

## *Statistical analysis using only C++*

- [x] Matrix calculation
- [x] Linear regression
- [x] Multiple regression
- [x] Sparse regression
- [ ] Nonlinear regression
- [x] Principal component analysis
- [x] Independent component analysis
- [x] Eigenvalue analysis
- [ ] Statistical causal search

----
The current aim is to create a **non-GPL C++ implementation** of a **linear non-Gaussian aperiodic model (LiNGAM)** which is one of the statistical causality search.

***Please wait.***  
**Execution efficiency and results are still bad.**  
**We are currently making modifications and changes.**  
**GPU support is experimental so performance is not good.**  
**The directory structure and file name will probably change in the future.**  

***progress***
